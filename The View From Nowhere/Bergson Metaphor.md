# **Transcending the Human Condition: Bergsonian Intuition and Nagelian Objectivity**

### **Abstract**

This paper reconstructs an implicit line of philosophical continuity between Henri Bergson’s claim that “philosophy should be an effort to go beyond the human condition” (*“la philosophie devrait être un effort pour dépasser la condition humaine”*) and Thomas Nagel’s account of the philosophical impulse in *The View from Nowhere*. Although Bergson and Nagel emerge from radically distinct traditions—one metaphysical and process-oriented, the other analytic and epistemological—both articulate philosophy as a movement of *transcendence* beyond ordinary human cognition. I argue that this structural similarity is not superficial: both thinkers diagnose a fundamental tension between the situated human standpoint and a more encompassing grasp of reality. Yet their diagnoses diverge in how they conceptualize the nature, the method, and the limits of this transcendence. The final section shows how comparing Bergson’s *duration* with Nagel’s “objective standpoint” yields a general account of philosophical method as oscillating between immersion and detachment.

# **1. Introduction: Philosophy as Exceeding the Human Standpoint**

In the opening pages of *The View from Nowhere*, Thomas Nagel writes that philosophy is driven by a desire “to transcend the contingencies of one’s personal perspective.”(^1) This desire, he claims, is neither incidental nor pathological: it is constitutive of philosophy itself. The impulse pushes us to widen our standpoint—first to include impersonal reasons, then to include other minds, and finally toward an ideal of objectivity that is “viewless”: an account of the world in which the particular standpoint of the knower disappears.

This formulation quietly echoes a claim made by Henri Bergson eight decades earlier:

> *“La philosophie devrait être un effort pour dépasser la condition humaine.”*(^2)

For Bergson, too, philosophy arises from an *effort to surpass* our evolved, utilitarian mode of relating to the world. Our ordinary intellect serves survival, not truth; philosophy therefore aims to *go beyond* the human condition by entering into the flux of reality (duration) through intuition.

The two thinkers diverge in language, tradition, and metaphysical commitments. Yet the structural parallel is striking: both describe philosophy as a *transcendent effort*, directed beyond the limits of ordinary cognition. That this connection has gone almost entirely unnoticed in the secondary literature indicates, not its weakness, but its interpretive potential.

This paper reconstructs the parallel as a philosophical thesis:

**Thesis:**
*Despite their methodological and metaphysical differences, Bergson and Nagel articulate a common structural conception of philosophy as a project of transcending the limitations built into the human standpoint; however, they differ fundamentally in how they understand both the nature of those limitations and the mode of transcendence.*

# **2. Bergson: Exceeding the Evolutionary Intellect**

### **2.1 The Human Condition as Evolutionary Constraint**

For Bergson, the human condition is not a metaphysical predicament but a biological fact. Our intellect evolved to handle solid objects, stable identities, and practical manipulation. Its categories—space, discrete concepts, inert substances—are “carved out” by evolutionary necessity.(^3)

Thus the human condition is defined by:

1. **Instrumental cognition**
   Designed for action, not contemplation.

2. **Spatialization of time**
   We treat time as if it were space: divisible, static, measurable.

3. **Reification**
   We substitute reality’s continuous flow with stable symbols.

This condition *distorts* reality. Our intellect breaks becoming into fixed concepts that enable survival but obscure real temporal creativity.

### **2.2 Philosophy as Exceeding: Intuition and Duration**

To surpass the human condition is to recover a direct sympathy with duration (*durée*). Intuition is not mystical; it is a deliberate method of re-entering the movement of life by suspending our utilitarian intellect.

Transcendence for Bergson is therefore:

* **genetic** (going back to the genesis of movement)
* **participatory** (entering into the flow)
* **creative** (uncovering novelty)

Thus Bergson’s transcendence is *positive*: a fuller contact with the richness of real becoming.

# **3. Nagel: From the Personal View to the View from Nowhere**

### **3.1 The Human Standpoint as Cognitive Attachment**

Nagel’s “human condition” is conceptualized differently. The problem is not biological distortion but *perspectival embeddedness*. Each of us experiences the world from a particular point of view, conditioned by:

* personal perspective
* sensory modalities
* affective orientation
* partial information
* first-person experiential structure

Objectivity is defined not as escape into pure reality but as the removal, step by step, of particularities tied to the self.

### **3.2 The Rising Arc of Objectivity**

Nagel maps transcendence as an *ascending arc*:

1. From the first-person viewpoint
2. To intersubjective reasons
3. To impersonal rationality
4. To an ideal limit of complete detachment

As he writes:

> “The objective standpoint is attained by leaving behind more and more of the features of one's own perspective.”(^4)

Unlike Bergson, who views transcendence as deepening immersion, Nagel views it as progressive **detachment**.

Thus Nagel’s transcendence is *negative*: a removal of subject-bound features.

### **3.3 The Paradox of the Human Condition**

For Nagel, transcendence is structurally limited: we can never fully abandon the subjective standpoint, because the very idea of “objectivity” is formulated by a particular human subject. Transcendence is therefore both necessary and impossible.

# **4. Structural Parallels: Two Models of Philosophical Transcendence**

Despite their differences, the following structural parallels emerge:

### **4.1 A foundational tension**

Both claim that philosophy arises from a tension between:

* our ordinary human standpoint, and
* a more encompassing grasp of reality.

### **4.2 Transcendence as the essence of philosophy**

Both view transcendence not as one task among others but as the driving impulse of philosophy itself.

### **4.3 The double structure: standpoint / beyond-standpoint**

In both cases, philosophy is defined by a bidirectional structure:

* *Man is part of reality,*
* *Yet as a knower he aims to understand reality from beyond his part.*

This paradox is the motor of philosophical thinking.

# **5. The Deep Divergence: Intuition vs. Detachment**

### **5.1 Nature of the limitation**

* For Bergson, the limit is *biological* and *instrumental*.
* For Nagel, the limit is *epistemic* and *phenomenological*.

### **5.2 Mode of transcendence**

* Bergson: go *deeper into* reality.
* Nagel: rise *above* one's standpoint.

### **5.3 What the transcendent standpoint reveals**

* Bergson: duration, becoming, creativity, the real.
* Nagel: universality, impartiality, objective structure.

The metaphysics differs profoundly.

### **5.4 Impossibility and possibility**

Bergson’s transcendence is **possible but difficult**; intuition is hard but attainable.
Nagel’s transcendence is **necessary but incomplete**; full objectivity is an ideal limit.

# **6. A Combined Insight: Oscillation as the Method of Philosophy**

If Bergson gives us *immersion* and Nagel gives us *detachment*, then philosophy may be defined as the **oscillation between these two movements**:

1. Moving outward — stripping away the subjective (Nagel).
2. Moving inward — entering into the flow of reality (Bergson).

This oscillation yields a meta-methodology:

* From Bergson: sensitivity to the richness and movement of phenomena.
* From Nagel: discipline of removing subjective distortions.

Philosophy becomes a dynamic interplay between two forms of transcendence.

# **Conclusion**

Bergson and Nagel belong to distinct metaphysical, historical, and methodological universes. Yet both articulate a single, enduring philosophical impulse: the aspiration to exceed the constraints of the human standpoint. For Bergson, this transcendence is a creative intuition that recovers duration; for Nagel, it is the ascent toward a universal standpoint that approaches the view from nowhere. Their differences illuminate the two poles of philosophical method: immersion in the depth of experience and detachment into universal structure.

Reading Bergson and Nagel together shows that philosophy is neither pure intuition nor pure objectivity but the continual negotiation between the two. The effort to surpass the human condition is thus not an escape from humanity but its highest expression.
